    <h1>A Story About Mittens!</h1>
    <h2>A Story of the Purrfect Crime</h2>

    <p>Mittens always stayed under the radar. All she ever wanted in life was a scratch post and some catnip.</p>
    <p>Here are a few of Mittens favorite objects:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Catnip</li>
        <li>Scratch post</li>
        <li>Cat bed</li>
          <ol>
            <li>Blue</li>
            <li>Red</li>
          </ol>
      </ul>
    <p>That all changed one night when Scruffs, the neighborly but also horrendously evil dog came to town. He took it all! He took the catnip, the scratchpost. He even took the beds! Red first, then Blue! Mittens would have to get... Revenge!</p>
